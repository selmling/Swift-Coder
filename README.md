Annotate video clips swiftly ⚡️
---

Problem this app solves:

- Need to annotate several video clips 
- Need binary (yes or no) annotations for each clip

Currently the app asks the user whether the person in the video clip is asking a question, yes or no. To customize what this app asks users to annotate, change line 17 in the `AnnotationView.swift` script.
